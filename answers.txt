Quesiton 1-5 client and echo_server

Question 1:
Specify the parameters (respectively): socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM
when you create a socket.socket().

Question 2:
The server socket listens (for a client connection), but doesn't actually start the connection.
The client socket starts a connection to a server socket that is listening.

Question 3:
We can use the line:
s.setsockopt(socket.SOL_SOCKET, socket.SO_REUSEADDR, 1)
Where the variable s is a TCP socket.

Question 4:
When we connect to the echo_server (using the command telnet localhost 8001, in my case), the output:
Connected by ('127.0.0.1', 51221)
Shows the IP addess of the client that connected, followed by a port.

Question 5:
(referring to the echo server)
full_data is returned from recv(), and that is a byte string containing the data sent from the client.

# telnet localhost 8001
# Ctrl+]
# sen echo Foobar
# quit
